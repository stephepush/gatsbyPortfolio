    "about": "Hi, I'm Stephen and I'm a self taught web developer. In the past, I've used vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS to build things, and I also dabbled with PHP and MySQL. Right now I'm building things using the React ecosystem. I have a few projects I've built with React (as well as some I built using vanilla javascript), and in the near future I'd like to take a deeper dive into React Hooks, the React Context API, Next.JS, and decoupled CMS' with react front-ends by utilizing those technologies in projects.\n In my spare time I enjoy cooking, especially perfecting pizza dough technique, and I've also been on a bit of a retro gaming kick.",
